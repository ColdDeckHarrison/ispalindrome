co-challenge
This was a pairing exercise with a mate that uses Ruby as a default. I was learning Python at the time and we shared screen on discord and worked through the problem. It still has a bit of kink to it but after another few months of programming, Ive found that it would have been much easier to use slice. 

I dont change this one because it helps show where Ive come from in terms of my learning and the fact that this was one of the first pairing challenges Ive done, it means a lot more to me incorrect than if I fixed it on my own.
